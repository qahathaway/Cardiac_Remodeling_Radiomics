# Ultrasonic Texture Features as Radiomic Biomarkers for Screening Cardiac Remodeling and Dysfunction

## Background:
Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) workflows allow for rapid screening of cardiac abnormalities for guiding appropriate early triage and management. Morphometry and textural features (radiomics) in POCUS images could aid in the rapid automated expert-level screening of left ventricular (LV) myocardial remodeling and dysfunction without requiring any quantitative measurements.

## Methods:
We developed Machine-learning (ML) models using three clinical cohorts that included 1,915 subjects: 1) an expert-annotated registry of POCUS (n=943, 80% training and 20% internal validation), 2) a prospective institutional POCUS cohort for external validation (n=275), and 3) a prospective external validation ML model on high-end ultrasound systems (n=484) for a head-to-head comparison of radiomics-based prediction with standardized quantitative measurements obtained during comprehensive echocardiography. Using automated high-throughput extraction of radiomic features from the parasternal long axis, we developed an explainable ML model and a direct image-derived black-box convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Following the clinical studies, we additionally explored the biologic link between radiomics biomarkers and myocyte remodeling in a murine experimental model of type 2 diabetes. Echocardiography of wildtype (n=10) and Leptr-/- (n=8) mice were assessed longitudinally at 3 and 25 weeks, and radiomic features of importance were correlated with histopathological features of myocyte disarray and hypertrophy observed in 25-week-old mice.
