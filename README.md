# Ultrasonic Texture Features as Biomarkers for Assessing Cardiac Remodeling and Dysfunction

## Background:
Changes in cardiac size, myocardial mass, cardiomyocyte appearance, and, ultimately, the function of the whole organ are interrelated features of cardiac remodeling that profoundly impact patient outcomes.

## Objectives:
We propose that cardiac ultrasound textural features (ultrasomics) can aid rapid, automated assessment of left ventricular (LV) structure and function without requiring manual measurements.

## Methods:
We developed machine-learning models using cardiac ultrasound images from 1,915 subjects in three clinical cohorts: 1) an expert-annotated cardiac point-of-care-ultrasound (POCUS) registry (n=943, 80% training/testing and 20% internal validation), 2) a prospective POCUS cohort for external validation (n=275), and 3) a prospective external validation on high-end ultrasound systems (n=484). In a type 2 diabetes murine model, echocardiography of wildtype (n=10) and Leptr-/- (n=8) mice were assessed longitudinally at 3 and 25 weeks, and ultrasomic features were correlated with histopathological features of hypertrophy.

## Results:
The ultrasomic model predicted LV remodeling in the POCUS and high-end ultrasound external validation studies (Area under the curve: 0.78 {0.68-0.88} and 0.79 {0.73-0.86}, respectively). Similarly, the ultrasomic model predicted LV remodeling was significantly associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in both cohorts (P<0.0001 and P=0.0008, respectively). Moreover, on multivariate analysis, the ultrasomics probability score was an independent echocardiographic predictor of MACE in the high-end ultrasound cohort (Hazard Ratio: 8.53 {4.75-32.1}, P=0.0003). In the murine model, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy positively correlated with two ultrasomic biomarkers (R2 = 0.57 and 0.52, Q<0.05).

## Conclusions:
Cardiac ultrasomics-based biomarkers may aid development of machine-learning models that provide an expert-level assessment of LV structure and function.
