# Ultrasonic Texture Features as Radiomic Biomarkers for Screening Cardiac Remodeling and Dysfunction

##Background: Changes in cardiac size, myocardial mass, cardiomyocyte appearance, and, ultimately, the function of the whole organ are interrelated features of cardiac remodeling that profoundly impact patient outcomes.

##Objectives: We propose that cardiac ultrasound textural features (radiomics) can aid rapid, automated assessment of left ventricular (LV) structure and function without requiring any quantitative measurements.

##Methods: We developed machine-learning models using cardiac ultrasound images from 1,915 subjects in three clinical cohorts: 1) an expert-annotated cardiac point-of-care-ultrasound (POCUS) registry (n=943, 80% training/testing and 20% internal validation), 2) a prospective POCUS cohort for external validation (n=275), and 3) a prospective external validation on high-end ultrasound systems (n=484). In a type 2 diabetes murine model, echocardiography of wildtype (n=10) and Leptr-/- (n=8) mice were assessed longitudinally at 3 and 25 weeks, and radiomic features were correlated with histopathological features of hypertrophy.
